# notes

Some of the things I've learned, with subjects so far including JavaScript, Docker and the shell. Currently hosted [here](https://barcek.github.io/notes).

Shares code with [rhizo](https://github.com/barcek/rhizo), components and supplementary files for a single-page app, written with Vue.js in TypeScript.
